# Contribution guidelines

If you found a bug, need a feature or whatever, just open an issue. 
If you are willing to implement it yourself: great, but you probably should wait with implementing anything until it has been discussed in the issue. 
(Otherwise it could happen, that your PR is (for whatever reason) rejected and all your hard work is moot).

All PRs are done against the **develop** branch and will then be released with the next release.
